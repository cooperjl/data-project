# Data Project
Project for university data module.
## Information
Database design using SQLite, transferring data from an unnormalised .csv.

Created five modelling solutions based off this banking data. Data read from database using SQL into pandas dataframes for each model.

Models created using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, visualised with matplotlib, and statistically analysed with scipy when relevant.

Results then evaluated and presented, as if to relevant stakeholders.
